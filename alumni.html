			<p> Fernanda Mendes - Class of 2010 
				My specialization is in Human-Computer Interaction.  
				I was the President of LCSC for Fall'08 to Spring '09.
				I have been in the Latino/a Computer Science club since it was founded in the Spring of 2007.  
				I joined the club because I knew that my involvement would have an impact in the direction of the club's future.  
				As our Computer Science department strives to become more diverse, I enjoy being a part of a community whose main goal is to support and retain underrepresented students in CS.
				What I like the most about LCSC is the opportunity to meet other students with similar backgrounds and interests as me
