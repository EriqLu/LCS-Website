	  <h2> Sponsors </h2>
	  <p> We thank our sponsors who help support our club running and help give back the community of color. </p>
	  <p> Without you, our club would never exist and the lack of diversity in the technical industries still continues. </p>
	  <p> Even though the United States & the UIUC Department of Computer Science still have a lack of students of color accept into the program, 
		  we hope the club would bring a message and huge significance of bringing under-represented students who are interested in computer science and engineering to be part of the program.
